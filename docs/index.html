<h4>Ethereum is a platform that creates innovative solutions on blockchain technology. It is a the next version of Bitcoin platform which could only transact values (Bitcoins). Ethereum allows you to define your own currency/asset based on smart contract standardization called ERC20. Using ERC20 you can create a new cryptocurrency and customize it for any domain like Banking, Insurance, Supplychain, Credit industry etc. </h4>

		<h4>GST tax credit can be maintained as good and services are delivered and consumed. This credit is mapped to a GSTIN number. The coin contract maps it to an ethereum address and retains the tax credit against the GSTIN. The transfer of credit by the GSTIN owner and by authorized third parties are executed as defined by ECR20 ethereum token standard.</h4>

		<h4>Various apps hosted by GST network providers will interact with GSTN APIs to execute tax transactions. This coin can be parallely cloud hosted to retain a transparent record of the GSTIN history of tax credit</h4>
